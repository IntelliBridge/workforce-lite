# Open WebUI

## Overview
Open WebUI is a self-hosted, open-source web interface that enables users to interact with large language models (LLMs). It provides several features such as voice-to-text, chat, and custom prompt handling. It is compatible with various LLM interfaces such as REST APIs (e.g., Ollama and OpenAI). Open WebUI can also be deployed without access to the public internet.
